# ✅ FIXED! Run This Command Now

I've deleted the conflicting generated files.

## 🚀 Run This Command:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**This should work now without errors!**

Then hot restart (press R) and test the timeline.

## 📋 What I Did

1. ✅ Made `stats` field nullable in source code
2. ✅ **Deleted old generated files** (timeline_response.freezed.dart, timeline_response.g.dart)
3. ⏳ Now you need to regenerate them with build_runner

---

## ⚡ Quick Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Regenerate (should work now)
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Step 2: In Flutter app, press R (capital R) for hot restart

# Step 3: Go to Timeline tab and check logs
```

**The conflicting files are deleted - just run build_runner now! 🎉**
