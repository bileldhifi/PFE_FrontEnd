# Testing Snapchat-Style Image Markers

## Prerequisites
‚úÖ Run code generation first:
```bash
cd /Users/bilel.dhifi/Desktop/PFE/travel_diary_frontend
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Fixed Issues
1. ‚úÖ Changed `addImage()` to `addStyleImage()` with correct parameters
2. ‚úÖ Reduced opacity on all media viewer widgets (80-85% vs 95-98%)
3. ‚úÖ Added image processing to create circular markers with borders
4. ‚úÖ Implemented click listeners for image markers

## What You Should See

### 1. On the Map
- **Before:** Orange circles at locations with posts
- **After:** Circular images showing the first photo from posts at each location
- **Style:** 
  - White border (8px)
  - Orange accent ring (3px)
  - 120x120px size
  - Looks like Snapchat map markers!

### 2. Media Viewer UI
- All overlays now have **lower opacity** (80-85%)
- Better visibility of the underlying images
- Subtle glassmorphism effect

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/bilel.dhifi/Desktop/PFE/exam
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/bilel.dhifi/Desktop/PFE/travel_diary_frontend
flutter run
```

### Step 3: Test Image Markers

1. **Navigate to Map**
   - Open a trip with posts that have images
   - Verify circular image markers appear instead of orange circles

2. **Check Marker Appearance**
   - Should show the first image from the first post at each location
   - White border around the image
   - Orange accent ring
   - Circular shape

3. **Test Click Functionality**
   - Click on an image marker
   - Should open the `MediaViewerScreen`
   - Should show all posts for that location

4. **Test Media Viewer**
   - Verify reduced opacity on all widgets
   - Caption should be more visible through the semi-transparent background
   - Swipe vertically between posts
   - Swipe horizontally between images within a post

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing
**Problem:** Markers don't appear or still show orange circles
**Solution:**
1. Check console logs for "Adding IMAGE media marker"
2. Verify posts have media with valid URLs
3. Ensure backend is running on `localhost:8089`
4. Check network tab for image download requests

### Images Not Loading
**Problem:** Markers show but images are broken
**Solution:**
1. Verify image URLs are accessible: `http://localhost:8089/app-backend/[media-url]`
2. Check CORS settings on backend
3. Verify media files exist in `exam/uploads/`

### Compilation Errors
**Problem:** Freezed/JSON errors
**Solution:**
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner clean
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Performance Issues
**Problem:** Map is slow when loading many markers
**Solution:**
- Images are downloaded asynchronously per marker
- Consider implementing:
  - Image caching (already in Mapbox style cache)
  - Lazy loading (only visible markers)
  - Lower resolution images (currently 120x120px)

## Console Logs to Watch

When markers load successfully, you'll see:
```
Adding IMAGE media marker for track point 123 at 48.8566, 2.3522
Loading image from: http://localhost:8089/app-backend/uploads/posts/[filename]
Created image media marker: [annotation details]
Added click listener for image marker at track point 123
```

## Expected Behavior

### Success Scenario
1. Map loads with trip polyline
2. Circular image markers appear at locations with posts
3. Console shows successful image loading
4. Clicking marker opens media viewer
5. All posts for that location are displayed

### Graceful Failure
If a track point has no media:
- No marker is shown (intentional)
- Console logs: "No media found for track point X"
- Map continues to work normally

## API Requirements

The feature requires:
1. ‚úÖ Backend running on `localhost:8089`
2. ‚úÖ Posts endpoint: `/posts/track-point/{trackPointId}`
3. ‚úÖ Media files accessible at: `/uploads/posts/[filename]`
4. ‚úÖ CORS enabled for image requests

## Feature Summary

This implementation creates a **Snapchat-style map experience**:
- Real post images replace generic markers
- Beautiful circular design with borders
- Smooth click-to-view interaction
- Professional glassmorphism UI
- Instagram-style carousel for multiple images/posts
