# 👋 START HERE - Travel Diary App

## ✅ All Errors Fixed!

I've fixed:
- ✅ CardTheme errors
- ✅ Removed Google Maps (no setup needed!)
- ✅ iOS version set to 13.0
- ✅ Created automatic cleanup script

---

## 🚀 Run the App (Super Simple!)

### **Just copy and paste this ONE command:**

```bash
./clean_and_run.sh
```

**That's literally it!** 🎉

The script will automatically:
1. Clean old files (including stale Google Maps files)
2. Install dependencies
3. Generate code
4. Run the app

## 📱 What You'll See

A beautiful travel app with:
- 🔐 Login & Register screens
- 📱 Feed with travel posts
- ✈️ My Trips management  
- 🗺️ World Map (placeholder UI)
- 👤 Profile & Settings
- 🔍 Search

All working with **fake data** - no backend needed!

---

## 🔥 While App is Running

- `r` = Hot reload (fast UI updates)
- `R` = Restart app
- `q` = Quit

---

## ⚡ Alternative Commands

**If script doesn't work, run these:**

```bash
# Clean
rm -rf build/ ios/Pods/ ios/Podfile.lock .dart_tool/

# Setup
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run
flutter run
```

---

## 💡 Tips

- **First time?** Just run `./clean_and_run.sh`
- **Errors?** Run `./clean_and_run.sh` again (it fixes most issues!)
- **Want Android?** Use `flutter run -d android` instead

**Enjoy the beautiful interfaces! 🎨✨**
