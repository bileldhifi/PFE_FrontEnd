# Setup Guide - Travel Diary App

This guide will help you get the Travel Diary app up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Flutter SDK** (3.9.2 or later)
   - Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   - Add Flutter to your PATH

2. **Dart SDK** (Comes with Flutter)
   - Version 3.9.2 or later

3. **IDE** (Choose one)
   - VS Code with Flutter extension
   - Android Studio with Flutter plugin
   - IntelliJ IDEA with Flutter plugin

4. **Platform-specific tools**
   - **iOS**: Xcode 14+ (macOS only)
   - **Android**: Android Studio with SDK 26+

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Verify Flutter Installation

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This downloads all the packages specified in `pubspec.yaml`.

### 3. Generate Code

The app uses code generation for models and JSON serialization. Run:

```bash
# One-time generation
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# OR use the provided script (make it executable first)
chmod +x generate.sh
./generate.sh

# OR for continuous generation during development
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 4. Run the App

#### For iOS Simulator (macOS only):
```bash
# Start iOS simulator
open -a Simulator

# Run the app
flutter run -d ios
```

#### For Android Emulator:
```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Run on Android
flutter run -d android
```

#### For Physical Device:
1. Enable USB debugging on your device
2. Connect via USB
3. Run: `flutter devices` to see your device
4. Run: `flutter run -d <device_id>`

### 5. Verify Everything Works

Once the app is running, you should see:
- The Feed screen as the home page
- Bottom navigation with 4 tabs
- Fake travel data displayed
- Smooth navigation between screens

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Command not found: flutter"
**Solution**: Add Flutter to your PATH
```bash
# For macOS/Linux, add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"

# Apply changes
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Issue: Build runner fails
**Solution**: Delete generated files and rebuild
```bash
# Delete generated files
find . -name "*.g.dart" -delete
find . -name "*.freezed.dart" -delete

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Issue: "CocoaPods not installed" (iOS)
**Solution**: Install CocoaPods
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
```

### Issue: Android licenses not accepted
**Solution**: Accept Android licenses
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

### Issue: Gradle build fails (Android)
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Making Changes to Models

When you modify any file with `@freezed` or `@JsonSerializable`:

```bash
# Automatic regeneration (recommended during development)
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 2. Hot Reload & Hot Restart

- **Hot Reload** (r): Quickly reload code changes
  - Preserves app state
  - Fast (~1 second)
  - Use for UI changes

- **Hot Restart** (R): Restarts the app
  - Resets app state
  - Slower (~3 seconds)
  - Use for state/logic changes

### 3. Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### 4. Building for Release

#### Android APK:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

#### Android App Bundle:
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
# Output: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

#### iOS:
```bash
flutter build ios --release
# Then use Xcode to archive and export
```
