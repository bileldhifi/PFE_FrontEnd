# Post Creation Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Complete post creation feature with media upload, following all `.cursorRules` for both Spring Boot and Flutter.

---

## ✅ Backend Implementation (Spring Boot)

### 1. **Updated Entities**
- ✅ `Post.java` - Already exists with proper relationships
- ✅ `Media.java` - Already exists for storing media files
- ✅ Supports `Visibility` enum (PUBLIC/PRIVATE)

### 2. **Updated DTOs**
- ✅ `PostRequest.java` - Includes location (latitude/longitude), trackPointId, text, visibility
- ✅ `PostResponse.java` - Includes media list, user info, location data
- ✅ `MediaResponse.java` - Already exists for media metadata

### 3. **Updated Controller**
**File:** `PostController.java`
- ✅ Handles multipart form-data for image uploads
- ✅ Gets authenticated user from Spring Security context
- ✅ Proper logging with SLF4J
- ✅ RESTful API design
- ✅ Follows cursorRules (constructor injection, descriptive names, proper docs)

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /posts/{tripId}
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Parameters:
- trackPointId (optional)
- latitude (required)
- longitude (required)
- text (optional - caption)
- visibility (required - PUBLIC/PRIVATE)
- images[] (optional - multiple image files)
```

### 4. **Updated Service**
**File:** `PostServiceImpl.java`
- ✅ Transaction management (@Transactional)
- ✅ File upload to `uploads/posts/` directory
- ✅ Validates image file types
- ✅ Creates post and media in single transaction
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ SOLID principles applied

### 5. **Security Configuration**
**File:** `SecurityConfig.java`
- ✅ Post creation requires authentication
- ✅ JWT token validation via `JwtAuthFilter`
- ✅ Static file serving for uploaded images (`/uploads/**`)

---

## ✅ Frontend Implementation (Flutter)

### 1. **Data Layer**

#### Models
**File:** `lib/post/data/models/post.dart`
- ✅ `Post` model with Freezed
- ✅ `PostMedia` model for media items
- ✅ JSON serialization
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

#### Repository
**File:** `lib/post/data/repositories/post_repository.dart`
- ✅ API client integration
- ✅ Multipart form-data upload
- ✅ Token-based authentication
- ✅ Error handling with proper logging
- ✅ Follows cursorRules (log instead of print, descriptive names)

### 2. **Presentation Layer**

#### Controller
**File:** `lib/post/presentation/controllers/post_controller.dart`
- ✅ Riverpod provider with `@riverpod` annotation
- ✅ State management for post creation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Run build_runner to generate `.g.dart` file

#### Screens
**File:** `lib/post/presentation/screens/create_post_screen.dart`
- ✅ Uses `ConsumerStatefulWidget` (Riverpod)
- ✅ Image picker (gallery + camera)
- ✅ Caption input (500 char limit)
- ✅ Error display with `SelectableText.rich` (red color)
- ✅ Small private widget classes (not methods)
- ✅ Lines ≤ 80 characters
- ✅ `const` constructors
- ✅ Calls backend API
- ✅ Shows loading states
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

**File:** `lib/post/presentation/screens/select_location_screen.dart`
- ✅ Passes trip ID to create post screen
- ✅ Uses cached data (no duplicate API calls)
- ✅ Clean widget composition

## 🚀 Usage Flow

### Backend
1. Start Spring Boot application
2. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
3. `uploads/posts/` directory will be created automatically
4. Access Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8089/app-backend/swagger-ui/index.html`

### Frontend
1. Run code generation (important!):
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

2. User flow:
   - Navigate to Map screen
   - Tap "Create Post" FAB
   - Select location (current GPS or track point)
   - Select images (from gallery or camera)
   - Write caption (optional)
   - Tap "Post"
   - Images upload to backend
   - Post created with media URLs
   - Navigate back to map

## 📋 Code Quality

### Backend (Spring Boot)
✅ Constructor injection
✅ Proper exception handling
✅ @Transactional for data consistency
✅ SLF4J logging
✅ RESTful API design
✅ Proper HTTP status codes
✅ JavaDoc comments
✅ SOLID principles
✅ camelCase naming

### Frontend (Flutter)
✅ Riverpod state management
✅ `log` instead of `print`
✅ `SelectableText.rich` for errors
✅ Lines ≤ 80 characters
✅ Small private widget classes
✅ `const` constructors
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Descriptive variable names
✅ Clean code structure

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Testing

1. **Generate Freezed files:**
   ```bash
   cd travel_diary_frontend
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

2. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd exam
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Configure API URL** (if needed):
   - Check `lib/core/network/api_client.dart`
   - Default: `http://localhost:8089/app-backend`

### Known Limitations

- Posts require at least one image (validation in place)
- Only image files supported (type validation in backend)
- Max file size: 20MB (configured in Spring Boot)
- Visibility options: PUBLIC or PRIVATE only

### File Storage

- Backend stores files in: `{project-root}/uploads/posts/`
- Files are served statically via `/uploads/**`
- Filenames are UUIDs to avoid conflicts

---

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ JWT authentication required for post creation
- ✅ User email extracted from JWT token
- ✅ File type validation (images only)
- ✅ File size validation (20MB max)
- ✅ SQL injection protection (JPA/Hibernate)
- ✅ CORS configured properly

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Backend:
- [ ] Create post with images
- [ ] Create post without images (should fail)
- [ ] Create post with invalid file type (should fail)
- [ ] Create post without authentication (should fail)
- [ ] Files are saved to disk
- [ ] Files are accessible via `/uploads/posts/{filename}`
- [ ] Post data saved to database
- [ ] Media records created with correct URLs

Frontend:
- [ ] Image picker works (gallery)
- [ ] Image picker works (camera)
- [ ] Multiple images can be selected
- [ ] Images can be removed
- [ ] Caption input works
- [ ] Character counter shows correctly
- [ ] Validation works (min 1 image)
- [ ] Loading state shows during upload
- [ ] Success: navigates back to map
- [ ] Error: displays in red SelectableText
- [ ] Error: error is selectable
- [ ] Authentication errors handled
